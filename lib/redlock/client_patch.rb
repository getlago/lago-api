# Redlock retry logic actually behaves the same whether there's an error (network, Redis error, etc.) or whether it
# fails to lock because the resource is already locked. So, if we enable redlock retry, whenever we try to enqueue a job
# for which there's already a job locked (enqueued or running), weâ€™ll try 3 times to enqueue the job causing a ~0.5s
# delay.
#
# This patch is used to work around this issue by retrying the lock acquisition only if there is a network error.
