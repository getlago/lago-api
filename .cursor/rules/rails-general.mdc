# Services
When creating a service class:
- the class always extend BaseService using `<`
- the class name should always end with `Service`
- the class should always be placed in `app/services/**/*.rb`
- Service class takes named arguments via the constructor and arguments are stored in instance variables.
- Each instance variable should have a private attr_reader declared
- Service class have one and only one public method named `call` and it never accepts arguments
- Service `call` method should always return `result`
- Service class must define a custom Result class following these rules:
  - By default, `Result = BaseResult`
  - If the service must return values, define them using `BaseResult[]`. Example of result returning a customer and a subcription: `Result = BaseResult[:customer, :subscription]`


# Jobs
To call the class service class asynchronously, create job:
- jobs should have the exact same fully qualified class name except it ends with `Job` instead of `Service`.
- the perform method of the job typically calls the matching service and forwards all it's arguements
- the service is called using the class method `call!`
- avoid using named parameters for jobs

Example of job calling a service:

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module SomeModuleName
  class MyGeneratedJob < ApplicationJob
    queue_as "default"

    def perform(organization, subscription)
      SomeModuleName::MyGeneratedService.call!(organization:, subscription:)
    end
  end
end

```

# Models
- New models must directly belong to an organization. Store the `organization_id` in the table, don't use `through:`

# Webhooks

To create a webhook:
- A webhook name is typically `resource.action`, for example: `customer.updated` or `alert.triggered`. Use other webhooks as example to follow.
- Create a service in `app/services/webhooks/`, typically named `Webhooks::ResourceActionService` like `Webhooks::CustomerUpdatedService`
- A service must define at least the following methods:
    - `current_organization` - how to get the organization from the model
    - `object_serializer` which typically calls a serializer class
    - `webhook_type` always the name like `resource.action`
    - `object_type` which is the object serialized. Reuse this method in the serializer `root_name` param
- Add the mapping `name` => Service class to the `SendWebhookJob::WEBHOOK_SERVICES` hash
- Write a test for the webhook class
