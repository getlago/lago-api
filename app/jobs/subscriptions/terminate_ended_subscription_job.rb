module Subscriptions
  # Handles async termination of ended subscriptions from `Clock::TerminateEndedSubscriptionsJob`.
  # Intentionally on the `default` queue: this job only triggers termination which schedules
  # billing separately — it doesn't perform billing itself, so it shouldn't compete
  # with billing jobs on the :billing queue.
